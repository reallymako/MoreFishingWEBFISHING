# MoreFishingWEBFISHING
MoreFishing is a new mod that adds 70+ new fish to WEBFISHING--to scratch your fishing itch!

hey you... have you ever wished that webfishing had... more fishing? well, i have the problem solver for you!!!
this is MoreFishing, by yours truly... me!!!
this mod adds 70 new fish! 32 freshwater, 32 saltwater, 10 rain, 2 alien and 2 trash species! (fish will be listed in replies)

this is v. 1.0.0, so there are bound to be issues... like:
may have compatibility issues with Webnautica
(there are things subject to change... fish will be removed and added, some sprites may ((well... all of them WILL change in the future at some point)) change.)

V. 2.0.0

first big update!!!
all sprites have been updated, multiple stat changes have been made to fish, and 9 new fish have been added!!
